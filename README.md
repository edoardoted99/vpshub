# VPSHub

A self-hosted control plane for managing all your servers from a single dashboard.

VPSHub uses an **agent-based architecture**: install a lightweight agent on each server, and manage everything from a central web hub — real-time metrics, web terminal, command execution, and alerts.

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────┐       wss://        ┌─────────────────────┐
│   Agent      │ ──────────────────► │       Hub           │
│  (your VPS)  │  metrics, commands  │  (web dashboard)    │
└─────────────┘                      └─────────────────────┘
```

- The **agent** is a single binary that runs on each target server. It collects system metrics, sends heartbeats, and executes commands received from the hub.
- The **hub** is a web app where you see all your servers, their health, and interact with them.

The agent connects **outbound** to the hub — no inbound ports needed on your servers.

## Features

- **Real-time dashboard** — live CPU, RAM, disk, and network metrics from all servers
- **Web terminal** — full interactive shell in the browser, no SSH client needed
- **Command execution** — run commands on one or many servers at once
- **Saved snippets** — predefined commands for common operations
- **Alerts** — get notified when a server goes down or resources hit thresholds
- **Agent enrollment** — add a server with a single command
- **Self-hosted** — your data stays on your infrastructure

## Quick Start

### 1. Deploy the Hub

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 2. Add a Server

Open the hub UI, create a new server, and copy the enrollment command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://your-hub/install.sh | bash -s -- --token <enrollment-token>
```

The agent installs itself, connects to the hub, and your server appears on the dashboard.

## Architecture

| Component | Tech | Role |
|-----------|------|------|
| Agent | Go | Metrics collection, command execution, PTY proxy |
| Hub Backend | Node.js + Next.js | API, WebSocket server, agent management |
| Hub Frontend | React + Tailwind | Dashboard, terminal, administration |
| Database | SQLite | Server registry, metrics, configuration |
| Terminal | xterm.js | Browser-based interactive shell |

## Security

- Agents authenticate with the hub via API keys issued during enrollment.
- All communication is encrypted over WebSocket + TLS.
- The agent runs as an unprivileged user; sudo escalation is opt-in.
- No SSH keys are stored on the hub — the agent model eliminates that need.
- All executed commands are logged for audit.

See [WHITEPAPER.md](WHITEPAPER.md) for the full technical design.
